## Description

This is a project i was tasked with for my final exam. We were tasked with creating a dynamic blog using an API where the admin can login and create and edit/delete blogposts and create new accounts. 
This project uses sessionStorage so the user will always be logged out if they close the browser regardless if they havent logged out or not. There is a great deal of work put into user feedback, preventing errors from the api.
I created a "dashboard" so they can filter and search through the posts, edit and delete.
